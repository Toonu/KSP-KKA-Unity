	description = The CIM-10 "Bomarc" (Or IM-99A for it's proper designation) is a 50's long range Surface to Air Missile developed by America. It's a plane that wanted to be a missile, with two ramjets and a booster to get it from point A to point B. It also gave rise to a pop music group called "The Bomarcs". Warranty void if used in music video footage.
