description = The AIM-4 falcon was one of the first missiles designed by Hughes Aircraft. Highly expensive, volatile, and prone to missing, it represents the pinnacle of Hughes Aircraft's ingenuity. With a hit rate of less than 10%, it strikes fear into the heart of any enemies. Warranty void if engine is lit.
