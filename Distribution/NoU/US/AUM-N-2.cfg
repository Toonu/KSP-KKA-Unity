	description = The AUM-N-2 is an American Anti-Ship missile developed in the late 1950's. In actuality, it is none of these things. It is a torpedo with wings and a jet engine strapped to it, that decouple once close enough to the target so it can do torpedo things. But for the sake of usability (and your sanity) it acts as a normal AShM. Warranty void if submerged.
